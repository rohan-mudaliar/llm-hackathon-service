            2: Does it include the brand name or any brand-specific elements
            3: Title should have all relevant information that differentiates it from similar products from same merchant or different merchants, e.g. for Printer it should have model number, model name, what are its key selling points, and cartridge sold with it if any. For products sold in packages e.g. pack of diapers it should tell about size of the diapers, exactly how many diapers it contains so customers can differentiate it from other diaper packs from the same brand, e.g. Product name - Pampers Overnight Pants XX-Large 22s
            
            Engagement_and_Appeal 
            
            1: The title is engaging and likely to attract attention.
            2. Does it entice customers to click and learn more
            
            The final score is average of scores across all 5 categories. We need to give output out of 10.
            If average is 4/5 , we output 8/10. Final output should contain the numerator as well for total score. 
            
            Rules:
            
            1. The title should not contain the price of the item.
            2. Title should not contain offer information
            3. The title should not contain shipping information
            4. The title should avoid containing complex product codes that are not in natural language

            Overall:
            
            Score: 8.8/10
            
            Reason: It excels in terms of clarity, relevance, keyword usage, and conciseness. It effectively communicates a key selling point but could be made slightly more engaging with a creative touch to enhance its appeal.
            
            Clarity_and_Relevance_Score:
            
            Score: 5/5
            
            Reason: The title is highly clear and extremely relevant to the product. It includes all the necessary keywords, such as "Brother LC411-4PK," "Brother genuine ink cartridge," and "4 color pack," providing a precise and accurate description of the product. There's no ambiguity or irrelevant information.
            
            Keyword_Usage_Score:
            
            Score: 5/5

            Unique_Selling_Point_Score(USP):
            
            Score: 4/5
            Reason: The title effectively communicates a key selling point, which is the authenticity and reliability of the product being "Brother genuine." This highlights an important aspect of the product. While it communicates a USP, it's not extremely detailed in terms of unique features or benefits.
            
            Engagement_and_Appeal_Score(1 to 5):
            
            Score: 3/5

It serves its primary purpose of providing essential product information but lacks creative elements or persuasive language that would make it more engaging or appealing.
            
            
            Examples of bad titles are below:
            
            Bad Title 1:

            Score: 4/10
            
            Reason: The title needs improvement in terms of clarity, relevance, keyword usage, conciseness, highlighting a unique selling point, and increasing engagement and appeal. Simplifying and focusing on essential product details would enhance its effectiveness."

            Score: 4/5
            
            Reason: The title is somewhat clear but includes multiple elements in brackets and descriptors like "mothers, weddings, brides, mothers," making it somewhat cluttered and confusing. Additionally, the inclusion of "[15% off when you use coupon]" and "[Made in Japan with peace of mind]" adds complexity and may not be directly relevant to the product.
            
            Keyword_Usage_Score:
            
            Score: 2/5
            Reason: While the title does include keywords like "Long dress," "rose pattern shantung black dress," and "Formal," it also includes non-essential information like the coupon offer and "Made in Japan with peace of mind." These extraneous elements affect the effectiveness of keyword usage.
            
            Conciseness_Score:
            
            Score: 2/5
            Reason: The title is quite lengthy and contains unnecessary information like the coupon offer and "Made in Japan with peace of mind." It could be significantly more concise by focusing on essential product details.
            
            Unique_Selling_Point_Score (USP):Score: 2
            Reason: The title mentions that the product is "Made in Japan," which is a relevant point, but it doesn't effectively highlight any unique features or benefits that would make the dress stand out from others. It's descriptive but lacks a strong USP.
            
            Engagement_and_Appeal_Score:Score: 2
            
            Reason: Due to its length, complexity, and lack of a concise and attention-grabbing element, the title is not particularly engaging or appealing. It doesn't effectively entice customers to learn more about the product.
